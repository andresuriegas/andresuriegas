# Hi, I'm AndrÃ©s ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer and aspiring UX/UI designer based in Sweden.

Back in October 2020 my learning journey started. As almost all of us, front-end developers, I started with HTML and CSS. Since then I moved to JavaScript, a little bit of React and Redux.

I'm passionate about building hihly-polished user experiences, and I love to be part of the whole development process. From designing and building a high-res prototypes to programming and deploying compelling online experiences.

In summary:

```javascript
const andresuriegas = {
  firstName: "AndrÃ©s",
  lastName: "Contreras Uriegas",
  age: 28,
  background: "Automotive Engineer",
  passions: ["Front-end Development", "UX/UI", "Travel Photography"],
  tools: [HTML, CSS, JavaScript React, Adobe_XD, Figma],
  hobbies: ["Climbing & Bouldering", "Video Games", "Movies", "Travel"] 
}
```


## Currently working on

Round 2 of [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

Also, I'm working on a website for a mock brewery called [The Blind Tiger and Co.](https://andresuriegas.github.io/blind_tiger/) My goal with this project is to reinforce HTML and CSS fundamentals, build a fully responsive website from the ground and add dynamic features with JavaScript.

In parallel, I'm taking this [Google UX Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design).
